This requires a little bit of some hard coding and it will require you to do this each time you preform an upgrade but if you open (from IIS) \apps\archerapp\Home.aspx and right before the closing script tag (</scipt>) you can add the following

            document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(event) { 
                setTimeout(function(){
                    var getFooterVersion = document.getElementsByClassName("rsa-version");
                    getFooterVersion[0].innerHTML += ' Server: WebServer10';
                },1000);
            });
			
When you load Archer, you'll see the following in the footer. 

If it appears that the change isn't working, make sure you clear your browsers cache.
